Keep Teams from going into Away status

AutoHotkey file to stop teams from going into Away. 
Simple Autohotkey script that runs in the background. Moves the mouse 1 Pixel to the right every 250 seconds (Roughly 4 minutes) 
Either download Autohotkey package from https://www.autohotkey.com/ and download the .ahk file or download the .exe (nothing dodgy in the .exe file but not recommended because I'm a random on the internet.)

To Run install Autohotkey from their website. Download .ahk file. Run as admin. 
To stop right click Tray Icon "H" and click exit.
